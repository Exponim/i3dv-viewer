A viewer for i3dv render files

### About

This is a handy viewer for viewing our i3dv render files. This software
is provided so that you can provide a hosted solution to viewing renders
on your site, should you so wish.

You can obtain renders at [i3dv.com](http://i3dv.com) for free. You can then
either use our embedded player or use this hosted solution.

### Getting Started

*to do* 

### Contributing

To contribute, fork the project and submit a pull request with detailed 
information regarding the modification. It would also be *very* helpful
for you to update any documentation that needs changing because of the
update.

#### Bugs

A bug is a demonstrable problem that is caused by the code in the 
repository. Good bug reports are extremely helpful - thank you!

Guidelines for bug reports:

1. **Use the GitHub issue search** — check if the issue has already been reported.

2. **Check if the issue has been fixed** — try to reproduce it using the latest master branch in the repository.

3. **Isolate the problem** — ideally create a reduced test case and a live example.

A good bug report shouldn't leave others needing to chase you up 
for more information. Please try to be as detailed as possible in 
your report. What is your environment? What steps will reproduce 
the issue? What browser(s), OS, and devices experience the problem? 
What would you expect to be the outcome? All these details will 
help people to fix any potential bugs.
